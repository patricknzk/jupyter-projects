# projects
The python sudoku project was developed on my own when I gained an interest in programming. The rest of the projects were assignments from a programming unit.

# Approximation_Of_Pi.ipynb
Numerical approximations of pi were estimated in python through an approximation of pi in another form. This helped understand how computers interpret numbers how that performing something that sounds trivial, such as computing the numbers of pi, can be computational intensive and is a great program to apply theory of computation to.

# Matrix_vector_multiplication.ipynb
Involved implementing different matrix multiplication methods which a set of matrices were then put through. The runtime was recorded and plotted. This introduced me to the concept of computaional complexity and how important it is to design code that runs efficiently.

# Zipf.ipynb
Code was designed to read through text documents and extract the words used in the text document into a frequency table. The frequency table was plotted and displayed the phenomena known as "Zipf's Law". I learnt how to process data of different types in python, as before I have primarily been dealing with sets of numerical data.
