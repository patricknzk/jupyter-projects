# projects
The python sudoku project was developed on my own when I gained an interest in programming. The rest of the projects were assignments from a programming unit.

# sudoku.py
This was my first big python project that was completed at the end of 2021, looking back at the code there are a lot of messy parts that slow down the code and a review is needed. However, this was a valuable project that taught me how to deal with programming challenges. I learnt that to deal with bigger problems you need to break them down, especially in this python file where there are many functions showcasing how much was involved. I learnt more about programming in this project than dealing with data in python, it was a very good first project. 

# Approximation_Of_Pi.ipynb
Numerical approximations of pi were estimated in python through an approximation of pi in another form. This helped understand how python interprets numbers and different methods of overcoming that.

# Matrix_vector_multiplication.ipynb
Involved implementing different matrix multiplication methods which a set of matrices were then put through. The runtime was recorded and plotted. This introduced me to the concept of computaional complexity and how important it is to design code that runs efficiently.

# Zipf.ipynb
Code was designed to read through text documents and extract the words used in the text document into a frequency table. The frequency table was plotted and displayed the phenomena known as "Zipf's Law". I learnt how to process data of different types in python, as before I have primarily been dealing with sets of numerical data.
